Apply the GIDAS editorial guidelines to revise this specification. Use the same
formal, technical voice and structure in every document. Ensure identical
headings for identical content.

For example, every spec must include sections titled "Positioning and Adoption
Model", "Scope", "Terminology", "Conformance Classes", "Security
Considerations", and "Privacy Considerations", with uniform phrasing across
repos. Merge or rename sections so shared concepts align (for example, use one
unified name for the Threat Model section).

Maintain precise, short sentences and a cold logical tone. Define all normative
requirements with MUST/SHOULD in RFC 2119 style (all-caps) and REQ-IDs per
`REQ-<COMP>-XX`. Do not repeat OpenAPI details in prose; describe invariants
and behaviors abstractly.

Include a ReSpec note in the introduction stating that the `openapi.yaml`
contracts are indicative ("suuntaa antavia") and that official schemas will be
finalized after the first reference implementation.

Follow the stakeholder table format
goal -> artifact -> verifier -> pathway in "Positioning and Adoption Model".

Finally, verify that any paragraph or bullet conveying the same idea as in the
other GIDAS specs is word-for-word identical. Use the same terms and phrasing
throughout to achieve end-to-end alignment.
